Living in Dublin, Ireland, I have recently graduated from the Textile and Surface Design
degree course in NCAD. Previously graduating from Visual Communications at IADT, 
Dun Laoghaire, in 2012. I am very interested in craft based design and work with screen
print, letterpress printing and weave. Please feel free to contact me about my work or any
potential projects you may have.
